#first step is to implement some code that allows 
#us to calculate the score for a single word. The function getWordScore
#should accept as input a string of lowercase letters (a word) 
#and return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules.



def getWordScore(word, n):

    Returns the score for a word. Assumes the word is a valid word.

    The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the
    word, multiplied by the length of the word, PLUS 50 points if all n
    letters are used on the first turn.

    Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is
    worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on (see SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES)

    n: integer (HAND_SIZE; i.e., hand size required for additional points)
    returns: int >= 0
