#Next, implement the function getGuessedWord that takes in two parameters
#- a string, secretWord, and a list of letters, lettersGuessed. 
#This function returns a string that is comprised of letters and underscores, 
#based on what letters in lettersGuessed are in secretWord. 
#This shouldn't be too different from isWordGuessed!

    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: string, comprised of letters and underscores that represents
      what letters in secretWord have been guessed so far.
