#completing the first part of hangman to be used later in problem set 3

#here, first implement the function isWordGuessed that takes in two parameters - 
#a string, secretWord, and a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This function returns a boolean 
#- True if secretWord has been guessed (ie, all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed) 
#and False otherwise.

def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    '''
    secretWord: string, the word the user is guessing
    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: boolean, True if all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed;
      False otherwise
